string.txt: 
contents define the input string str[1 . . . n]. It is safe to assume the following about this input file:
- It will contain only a single line of ASCII characters defining the string.
- All characters are in the ASCII range [36, 126]
- The string contained in the input file will always terminate with the unique character $ (ASCII 36).

pos.txt:
containing a list of positions {i1, i2, . . . , im} in the following format:
This file will contain m lines, and each line gives a position of some suffix specified in 1-based indexing. (See example below.)
It is safe to assume the following about this input file:
– The list of positions are non-redundant – meaning all positions in the input file are distinct (without repeats).
– Each listed position is in the range [1, n].

q1.py: My solution codes for question 1

output_q1.py: The output file in the same format as the input <positionsFileName>,
except that each line in the output file contains the lexicographic rank of the corre-
sponding suffix among the list of all suffixes.
